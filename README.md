 ### spring-cloud-pre module
 * &nbsp;&nbsp; The preparation for Spring Cloud
 * &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.For Spring Boot, the configuration file application.properties and application.yml are chosen one by one.
 * &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.In the traditional SpringMVC architecture, we generally put JSP and HTML pages under the webapps directory, 
 but Spring Boot does not have webapps, and there is no web.xml. If we want to write the interface, what should we do?   
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Spring Boot officially provides several template engines: FreeMarker, Velocity, Thymeleaf, Groovy, mustache, JSP.  
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Create two directories under resources: static and templates   
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The static directory is used to store static resources, such as CSS, JS, HTML, etc. 
 The templates directory stores the template engine files. We can create a file under templates: index.ftl 
 (freemarker default suffix is .ftl)
